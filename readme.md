This project works with python and therefore uses virtual environments.

Ensure that you have python >= 3.12.


First create the env folder:

```
python3 -m venv env
```

Then activate the environment:
```
source env/bin/activate
```


The terminal should show (env)... when the environment is active.

To install required dependencies run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
